# QT-Cad

A paint that works with 2D forms based in QT without using scene or graphicsview. Actually I'm trying to map all points by myself to keep
the control in my hands, that means no responsabilities to QT that works just to output.

It was my first attempting to structure a project in C++, I'll refactor as soon as possible.
